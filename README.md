Hypothesis Statement:

We hypothesize that the initial and increasing presence of Airbnb in major cities drives an increase in housing and rental costs overall. 
We’ll examine relationships between:
-	A city’s housing and rental costs trend over time before and after Airbnb’s presence (began Aug 2008)
o	X = time
o	Y = average housing/rental cost
-	Comparing each city’s rate of change/Airbnb occupation
o	X = time
o	Y = average housing/rental cost growth % & Airbnb growth % since start date 
o	Labels = city
-	The impact of average rental cost increases and housing sale cost increases since Airbnb’s presence
o	

Why Airbnb? Does it have more use than VRBO/homeaway? 
When to start data trend? 2000-2009 = before, 2010-current = after
